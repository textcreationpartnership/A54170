            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Wonder mightily at the News you ≈øend me, that ≈øo many of the Town are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe to the
<hi>Repeal</hi> of the <hi>Penal Statutes;</hi> ≈øurely you mean the Clergy of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Church, and tho≈øe that are Zealous for their Dignity and Power: For what part of the Kingdom has felt the Smart of them more, and at all times, and on all occa≈øions repre≈øented their mi≈øchief to the Trade, Peace, Plenty and Wealth of the Kingdom, ≈øo freely as the Town has always done? But you unfold the Riddle to me, when you tell me <hi>'tis for fear of Popery,</hi> tho' I own to you, I cannot comprehend it any more than you do Tran≈øub≈øtantiation: For that we ≈øhould be afraid of Popery for the ≈øake of Liberty, and then afraid of it becau≈øe of Per≈øecution, ≈øeems to me ab≈øurd, as it is, that Liberty ≈øhould be thought the high way to Per≈øecution. But becau≈øe they are upon their fears, pray let me tell you mine, and take them among the re≈øt in good part.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Romani≈øts</hi> ≈øeek ea≈øe by Law, 'tis an Argument to me they de≈øire to turn good Countreymen, and take the Law for their Security, with the re≈øt of their Neighbors; and a greater Complement they cannot put upon our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Con≈øtitution, nor give
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34277:2"/>a better pledge of their de≈øires to be at Peace with us. But if we are ≈øo Tenacious as we will keep on foot the greate≈øt blemi≈øh of our Reformation, <hi>Viz.</hi> our <hi>Hanging, Quartering, Plunder, Bani≈øhing Laws;</hi> Is it not turning them out of this quiet Cour≈øe, and telling them if they will have ea≈øe they mu≈øt get it as they can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>or we will never conceed it? And pray tell me if this be not thru≈øting them upon the methods we fear they will take at the ≈øame time that we give that; for the rea≈øon why we do ≈øo?</p>
            <p>If Law can ≈øecure us, which is the Plea that is made, we may doubtle≈øs find an expedient in that which may repeal the≈øe, if the danger be not of Liberty it ≈øelf, but of our loo≈øing it by them at la≈øt; for there is no mi≈øchief the wit of Man can invent, that the wit of Man cannot avoid. But that which (I confe≈øs) makes me melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is, That methinks we never made more ha≈øte to be cou≈øened, no, not in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs of the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence,</hi> when in the name of Property that was actually damn'd, which at lea≈øt reprieved it; and the price of the <hi>Church of England</hi> gave for it, <hi>Viz.</hi> her promi≈øe of a Legal Ea≈øe actually failed us: For in≈øtead of ≈øaving our ≈øelves from Popery, we are by the≈øe partialities provoking it every day, and methinks fooli≈øhly for our own ≈øafety; becau≈øe there can be no other end in doing ≈øo, than ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing that Party which calls it ≈øelf the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that is in her Con≈øtitution, none of the be≈øt Friends to Property; for Mens Liberties and E≈øtates are by her Laws made forfeitable for Non-conformity to her: And I challenge the Records of all time ≈øince Popery got the Chair in <hi>England,</hi> to produce an eighth part of the Laws to ruin Men for Con≈øcience, that have been made ≈øince the other has been the national Religion, which is (I ≈øay,) a ≈øcandal to the Reformation.</p>
            <p>She ≈øays, ≈øhe is afraid of Popery, becau≈øe of its Violence, and yet u≈øes Force to compel it; <hi>Is not this re≈øi≈øting Popery with Popery?</hi> which we call loving the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon but hating the Traytor: She would have power to Force or De≈øtroy others, but they ≈øhould not have power to Force or De≈øtroy her, no not to ≈øave them≈øelves: Shift the hand never ≈øo often this <hi>Weapon</hi> is ≈øtill the ≈øame. 'Twere happy therefore that all Parties were di≈øarm'd of this Sword, and that it were put where it ought only to be in the civil Magi≈øtrates hand, to terrifie Evil Doers, and cheri≈øh tho≈øe that do well, remembring St. <hi>Peter's</hi> ≈øaying (in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s ca≈øe) for an Example, <hi>I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive now of a truth that God is no re≈øpecter of Per≈øons, but tho≈øe that fear him and work Righteou≈øne≈øs in all Nations, ≈øhall be accepted:</hi> El≈øe what ≈øecurity do's the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> give to the great Body of her Di≈ø≈øenters, that ≈øhe will not do what ≈øhe fears from Popery, when ≈øhe has a Prince of her own Religion upon the Throne, that has made ≈øo fair a Progre≈øs the≈øe la≈øt Six and twenty Years in ruining Families for Non-conformity, under Princes of another Per≈øwa≈øion. Come, Intere≈øt will not lye, ≈øhe fears Liberty as much as Popery: Since tho≈øe that want, and Plead for the one, are an hundred times more in number than the Friends of the other, and all of her ≈øide, that Popery ≈øhould not mount the Chair: So that ≈øhe would get more than ≈øhe would lo≈øe by the Repeal, if an equal de≈øire to ≈øubject both Popi≈øh and Prote≈øtant Di≈ø≈øenters to her Power and Government, be not the Principle ≈øhe walks by in her pre≈øent Aver≈øion.</p>
            <p>And to ≈øhew you that this is the ca≈øe, and that her Aver≈øion to Popery is a ≈øham to the Liberty de≈øired, the Di≈ø≈øenters are of no u≈øe to her, while the Penal Laws are on foot; for by them they are put in the power of a Prince of the Religion of the Church ≈øhe fears; but the moment they are Repealed, ≈øo far as concerns the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Popery to be National, the Di≈ø≈øenters are equally intere≈øted with the <hi>Church of England</hi> again≈øt it. But then here is the mi≈øchief, This Liberty takes the Rod out of her hand, ≈øhe can no more <hi>whip People into her Churches,</hi> and ≈øhe perhaps
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34277:2"/>may mode≈øtly ≈øu≈øpect her own Vertue and Ability to preach them thither.</p>
            <p>In ≈øhort, if ≈øhe were in earne≈øt again≈øt Popery, more than in love with her own Power and Grandure; that is, if the World were not in the way, ≈øhe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to deliver Men of her own Religion, that are ≈øo much more numerous than the Papi≈øts, that they migh ballance again≈øt her fears of their prevailing: But to cry ≈øhe is for Liberty to Prote≈øtant Di≈ø≈øenters, and make the demon≈øtration of it, her <hi>keeping up the Laws that ruin them,</hi> and then ≈øay it is for fear of the Religion the Prince owns, and yet force them into his hands by doing ≈øo, is, I mu≈øt confe≈øs, ≈øomething incomprehen≈øible.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides properly and naturally ≈øpeaking, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the People of
<hi>England,</hi> and when it's apply'd to a Party, 'tis a Faction to the whole; and that Title has no more truth in it, then 'tis ≈øence to ≈øay the Roman Catholick Church, which in Engli≈øh is a particular Univer≈øal Church: And pray is there no room left to con≈øider this hard ca≈øe of the Kingdom? I hope the Civil Magi≈øtrate will, who is the Supream Pa≈øtor of this Civil Church on Earth. Is ≈øhe then no more than a Party? no certainly. And how great a one, a true Liberty of Con≈øcience would be≈øt tell us, and that is the true rea≈øon, and not Popery, that ≈øhe is tender in the Point.</p>
            <p>I conclude then, that whil≈øt tho≈øe of that Religion only de≈øire to be upon the Level with others; I mean upon <hi>Native Rights,</hi> the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> what we all of us call our
<hi>Birth-right,</hi> let us not refu≈øe it, le≈øt God ≈øuffer them to prevail to curb our partiality. There are Laws enough to puni≈øh Offenders again≈øt the State, if the≈øe were repealed, and not condemn people by <hi>Anticipation. That Law which catches a Prote≈øtant, will catch a Papi≈øh Traytor, Riotor, or Seditious Per≈øon.</hi> Again, let us reflect, that we have a Prince of Age, and more Honor; the pro≈øpect of three excellent Princes of the Prote≈øtant Religion, the paucity of the Papi≈øts, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Enemies of their Communion, their unity in that Aver≈øion: What great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ≈øecurity can we have in the World? <hi>Policy, Honor, Religion, Number, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nity, ay, Nece≈ø≈øity too,</hi> con≈øpire to make us ≈øafe: For all the≈øe are concerned in the means of our pre≈øervation; unle≈øs our fears and our follies ≈øhould prevail, which I confe≈øs I apprehend mo≈øt: For they will be de≈øerted of God, that for≈øake him and them≈øelves too; <hi>Who dare to a certain evil that a ≈øuppo≈øed good may come of it, contradict their own Principles, deny what they expect, ≈øow what they would not reap, do to others what they would not that others ≈øhould do to them:</hi> But there is a God in Heaven, and he is ju≈øt: He will meet to us what we mea≈øure to one another, and his Judgement is inevitable. I therefore advi≈øe the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be as ready in her Chri≈øtian complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as is po≈ø≈øible. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Becau≈øe it is impious to keep up de≈øtroying Laws for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, when her Saviour tells her upon this very Que≈øtion, <hi>That he came not to de≈øtroy Mens lives but to ≈øave them. Secondly,</hi> Becau≈øe by this ≈øhe will wipe off the Reproach ≈øhe throws, by continuing them upon her own Apologies for Liberty of Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when under the wheel of Power. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becau≈øe Liberty to the Papi≈øts by Law, is bringing them into the legal intere≈øt of the Kingdom, and will prevent the force they may el≈øe be driven too, by being made and left de≈øperate: For 'tis not to be thought they will willingly pay the reckoning in another Reign, if by any means they can prevent it; and keeping up the Penal Laws can be no ≈øecurity to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> She hereby ≈øaves her Di≈ø≈øenters; and if it be really her inclination to do ≈øo, ≈øhe has no other way, and this unites them to her in Affection and Intere≈øt, if not in Wor≈øhip. But if (on the contrary) ≈øhe per≈øi≈øts ob≈øtinately to refu≈øe this natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34277:3"/>paciffick; the Di≈ø≈øenters I hope, will con≈øider their hone≈øt Intere≈øt, <hi>Con≈øcience and Property,</hi> and imbrace tho≈øe opportunities to ≈øecure them, that God in his all-wi≈øe Providence is plea≈øed to yield them in this conjuncture. Thus Gentlemen, you have my Thoughts upon your News; pray communicate them to our Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and believe that I am,</p>

               <p>FOr the <hi>Te≈øts</hi> that are ≈øo much di≈øcour≈øed of, I ≈øhall only ≈øay, that 'tis another My≈øtery of the Times to me, how the Church of <hi>England</hi> that was again≈øt the
<hi>Exclu≈øion,</hi> can be for them that were de≈øign'd for a <hi>Preamble</hi> to it; ≈øince in ≈øo doing, ≈øhe is for that which was contrived to introduce the <hi>Exclu≈øion</hi> ≈øhe was ≈øo Zealou≈øly again≈øt. I confe≈øs, I never under≈øtood her very well, and ≈øhe grows more and more unintelligible; but this I know, that ≈øhe mu≈øt either be ≈øorry for what ≈øhe has done, or ≈øhe did not know what ≈øhe did. The fir≈øt reflects upon her Loyalty, the la≈øt upon her Under≈øtanding; and becau≈øe I think that the lea≈øt and likelie≈øt evil, I conclude ≈øhe is no Infallible Guide upon the Que≈øtion.</p>
               <p>Another thing you tell me that gives great offence, is, His Maje≈øties turning out Prote≈øtants, and putting in People of his Religon. This I conceive a fault that the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is only an≈øwerable for. Other Princes have been ≈øo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to ≈øuffer
<hi>Te≈øts</hi> and <hi>Marks</hi> of di≈øtinction that have broken and di≈øordered their Kingdoms, by depriving tho≈øe of their Temporal comforts that would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; and this People e≈øteemed a mighty Grievance; and were frequent and elegant in their Complaints about it. We have a King now that would remove the≈øe <hi>Marks</hi> of di≈øtinction, and ≈øecure all Men upon their native Right and Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that all Parties might ≈øit ≈øafely under their own Vine, and under their own Fig-tree; ≈øo that now, <hi>who is for Liberty?</hi> becomes the
<hi>Te≈øt.</hi> Are they then fit to be tru≈øted that are out of his Intere≈øt, and again≈øt the Liberty he is for, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wants and craves? Or is it good ≈øen≈øe, that he (who is mortal as well as other Men) ≈øhould leave the Power in tho≈øe hands, that to his Face ≈øhow their aver≈øion to the Friends of his Communion tho' he offers to maintain her ≈øtill? She had the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to keep them, upon that Principle that mu≈øt heal and ≈øave the Kingdom, <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Con≈øcience;</hi> which ≈øhows the King was willing to be ≈øerved by her Sons to chu≈øe, if upon the ≈øame general Principle with him≈øelf: Wherefore 'tis the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> that turn them≈øelves out of Power, rather than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Liberty of Con≈øcience to others; and ≈øhall this Vice be their Vertue. They mu≈øt be heartily in love with Per≈øecution that can Sacrifie their places to the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Penal Laws for Religion, becau≈øe they would not let others, not only, not come in, but not live at their own Charges: A fine thing to ≈øuffer for. Their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øtors were Martyrs by Penal Laws, but the≈øe for them. The cau≈øe is chang'd whatever they think, and I am afraid they are chang'd too for want of thinking. I profe≈øs I pity them with all my Heart, and wi≈øh them more wit, and better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences again≈øt next time, if ever they have it; for the≈øe (if they will believe me) will hardly ever make ≈øo good a Bargain for them, as they have lo≈øt by them. More of this, if you like it, next time, and till then Adieu.</p>
